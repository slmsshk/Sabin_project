      "3. High-pressure sales tactics: The listing repeatedly emphasizes the urgency to act fast and not miss out on the opportunity, which is a common tactic used in fake listings.\n",
      "4. Generic language: Phrases like \"Spectacular Views,\" \"Exclusive Beach Access,\" and \"Desirable Paradise Cove\" are generic and do not provide detailed information about the property.\n",
      "5. Limited parking and remote location: Mentioning limited parking and a remote location without providing further details can be a red flag for a fake listing as it lacks information that genuine listings would typically include.\n",
